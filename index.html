      <h1>Play Pig Dice!</h1>
      <p>Pig Dice is a dice game where players take turns repeatedly rolling a die to compete in points.  For each turn they can roll until they decide to "hold", increasing their total score by that amount.  If a "1" is rolled, they score nothing for that turn and their turn ends.  The first player to score 100 or more points wins!</p>
